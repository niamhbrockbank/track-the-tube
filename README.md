# Track the Tube

## Introduction

The London Underground, also known as the Tube, is one of the most iconic and extensive public transportation systems in the world. Millions of people use it daily to commute, but for many, the journey can become mundane and repetitive. Track the Tube aims to transform this daily routine into an exciting adventure, making users appreciate the vast underground network and rediscover the joy of commuting.

## Project Objective

It encourages users to interact with different stations and lines, discover new routes, and collect achievements, all while fostering a sense of exploration and appreciation for this remarkable urban infrastructure.
